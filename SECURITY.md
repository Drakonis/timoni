# Security Policy

This document defines security reporting, handling and disclosure for the Timoni project.

## Report a Vulnerability

You can privately disclose a vulnerability through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/stefanprodan/timoni/security/advisories) mechanism.

Another option is to contact Stefan Prodan on Keybase messenger at
[keybase.io/stefanprodan](https://keybase.io/stefanprodan)
(fingerprint `613BF2C4D985BBCB1474123F5A00A04500683EBD`).

You will be able to choose if you want public acknowledgement of your effort and how you would like to be credited.

### Disclosures

Vulnerability disclosures are made public on GitHub's
[security advisories](https://github.com/stefanprodan/timoni/security/advisories) page.

Disclosures will contain an overview, details about the vulnerability,
a fix that will typically be an update, and optionally a workaround if one is available.

Disclosures will be made public in a timely manner after a release is published that fixes the vulnerability.
